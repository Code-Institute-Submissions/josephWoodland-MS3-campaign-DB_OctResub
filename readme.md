## The App Brief

This is a copy of the brief [here](assets/readme/assets/Brief%20-%20Cook%20It.pdf)

## Summary of the brief

The client requested a simple MVP to test the concept of the app. Something that they cna put out into the marketplace to test the reaction. This meant that the app should have the core functionality of the business idea, giving the first test users the chance to create campaign's and then donate to other users campaigns.

The app will be accesable from marketing campaigns through social media, this means that the app must be functional from mobile, even if the design on mobile is limited, the basic functionlity must be there.

The look of the app must be clean and more importantly functional, and clear to teh user what is going on. They have expressed that the desgin of the app can be looked at further down the Road map and to make sure that the vast morjority of the budget to be spent on the functionlity.

## UX

### Target Audience

The target audience for this project can be split into two camps. Professinol users with a decent desposible income to have the ability to donate money to what they can determin as a good cause, and also users who are looking to achive something and need the money for whatever their goal is. Both users are predicted to be melinials and gen Z so will be familar with technolgy, so as as long as the design follows what could be thought of as traditinal placments of UI objects then =the users sholuld be comfortable to navigate to achive the set goals. 

## Website Goals

### Client

  To make a web application that:

- is easy to use and understand.
- will motivate/draw users back to the site each week.
- has some sort of personal aspect to the site
- does not move the users around different pages (to make the app feel quicker.

### Users

As a user I want:

- a program that can create/tailor a meal plan for me
- to be able to have the plan fit my diet
- to have fast/easy access to recipes that I can cook myself
- to be able to save plans or recipes that I have liked so I can have access to them again quickly

### Functions for the app

The app must:

- have the ability to make the app personal for each user.
- have the ability to allow the user to input data into the app tp create a meal plan.
- create suggestions based on the user input i.e. Dietary information.
- be able to show the recipe for each meal suggestion.
- have a save function that stores recipe plan data, allowing the user to see/access previously saved recipes
- be quick and ensure users do not need to access multiple pages (unecsearily).

## User Journey

This is an example of a successful user journey.

I have been redirected to this app via email.
I am interested in looking at the meal plan creator.
I can easily find and input all of my dietary needs.
I can quickly see what suggestions have been made by the computer.
I like the suggestions I have been given and will save the results.
I can quickly see from the plan how to make each recipe
I can store these recipes separately, so I can have quick access to them (within and outside of the app) during the plan that has been created for me.
I was able to create a personalized meal plan quickly and easily and I'm looking forward to using the site again to create next weeks meal plan.

## Sections of the Web App

### General Layout

Given the brief from the client, we are looking at a desktop-first approach, making the app a single static page that fills the screen and will adapt to each screen size. They would like to have pop up modals to show different information.

### Navigation bar

The navigation bar will be static and have space to add and hide interactive buttons if needed.

### Home section

The home section should be clean and have enough space to fit all the necessary potential information that is needed. I.e. a weekly meal plan; so all is easy to see and understand.

### Popup Modal

The modal must carry on in line with the brand and design of the web app. It must have enough space in the main section of the modal to fill in all the necessary information from potential recipes. It should also be easily accessible and made simple to navigate.

Lastly, the modal must be interactive (and not moving from place to place) to create a better user experience.

### Footer

The footer on this project is not especially important, as no information is needed to deliver the clients needs or enhance the user experience. As such, it will be enough for the footer to display a picture as a design element, to break up the page content.

## Wireframes

Here is a sample of the original wireframes for the app approved by the client.

![desktop](assets/readme/xd/landing.png)

All the wire-frames and design boards can be downloaded [here](assets/readme/xd/CookIt%20-%20Wireframes.xd)

<span
 id="#design">
 </span>

## Design

The design elements were influenced and informed by the client’s brief, specifically the client’s brand guidelines which included the look and feel and TOV (tone of voice).

### Font

### Copy

- Noto Sans JP and as a back up sans-serif

### Main colours

Brand colours are ![brand](assets/readme/xd/colourPalette.png)

## Features for the website

### Responsive design

- Website must be functional, but focused on larger screen sizes.

### Interactive page

- Page HTML must be interactive for the user and must feel fluid.

## Technologies Used

### Languages

HTML5 - I used HTML 5 for the layout and structure of the website.

CSS - CSS has been used to style the HTML 5 elements.

Vanilla JavaScript - Javascript has been used to make the HTML 5 elements interactive for the user and to mutate the on screen HTML

## API - Spoonacular

I used the Spoonacular API to work with using JavaScript to make calls to the API and fetch the data.

Follow the link to see the API documentation.

[Spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs/)

## Styling Architecture - SCSS

As I am coding different elements on the page - some of which are only visible on user interaction - I have decided to use SCSS architecture to write my code.

Using the import feature of SCSS would first allow me to structure the architecture of the project in a much cleaner way. This style of architecture allows for smaller files that can be easily connected and identified.

Allowing the use of variables makes it easy if there are any brand changes that could potentially come up.

Using the nesting feature of SCSS allows for cleaner code, making site upkeep and bug fixes easier to locate and address.

## Coding Architecture - MVC

I am using the MVC(Model - View - Controller) architecture to organize my JS files. I found this way of organizing my file base easy to understand, clean to look at, and designed in a way to reduce the length of single js files.

The Model.js page is there to handle all the data that is used by the app, making it easier to search for and identify any problems with the use of data.

The View.js files are handling anything to do with changing the view of the HTML, anything that prints or replaces HTML.

The Controller.js file will have anything to do with the connection between the two pages; calling the initial information needed to start the app.

## VS Code

I used VS Code as my code editor. In the code editor, the extensions that I used were:

- Prettier: to automatically format my code for basic formatting mistakes and to have a consistent style throughout the code.
- Npm: I used this extension to give npm support for the version of VS Code I have.
- Image preview: I used this extension that shows a preview of any linked images in my code to help me quickly identify if the URL path is correct and to identify the right image.
- Markdown all in one: I used this which enabled me to edit the readme file with live preview in VS Code.

## Node modules

I used basic node modules to help me code in a smoother and more organized approach.

- Devsever: I used the dev server module to live to reload my project, on a change of the code. This made it easier to see changes I had been making to the code.

- Node-sass: I used this node so I could use the SCSS file and architecture.

- Watch sass: I used this module to compile the SCSS structure and architecture that I was using into a CSS format.

- Autoprefixer: I used this extension to add prefixes to my code for added browser support.

- Font Awesome: I used this extension to integrate free icons into the page.

## Outside libraries

- Google font: I used the Google font library for the font family on the website.

## CSS Pseudo-classes

- Hover: I used the hover class to change the state of various items over the page. This is a familiar convention that signals to the site visitor the interactive site elements/features they can engage with.

## JavaScript

I used JavaScript to compute the logic of my project; I have highlighted some of the more recent static sugar only available in the later version of JavaScript.

- Spread operator: I used this when retrieving the data from the local storage to spread the object and then search for matching keys.
  
- Async and Await: I used this method when making calls to the API, combined with the fetch method. I think it makes the code more self-explanatory.

## Software Used

- Git: This was used to manage the different versions of my project, using different branches to test and add new features/sections to the website. Once tested they were then merged into the master branch and then, using Git Desktop pushed to the Git Hub repository.

- Git Desktop: I used this to manage commits and push them to the GitHub repository.

- Source tree: I used this to manage my git branches, and to edit commit messages.

- GitHub: I used GitHub to store the version of the project remotely.

- Adobe XD: I used XD to create and build the wireframes, to design some of the unique icons on the page and the unique colour patterns on the page.

## Testing

### Automated Code Validation

I passed the code through the online code checking tool [w3validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

- Html Code has passed through the validator with no issues or warnings.
![image of](assets/readme/assets/test-results/HTML.png)
- CSS code passed through the validator with no issues or warnings.
![image of](assets/readme/assets/test-results/CSS.png)

- JShint - I used `/*jshint esversion: 20 */` at the top of each page to stop syntax errors from the use of modern JS. During this process I received a warning about the line break in the ternary function in the code. After researching why this happened, I identified an issue with JShint and not the code itself. In response, I added `/* jshint laxbreak: true */` to skip these lines in the code.
- JShint: there was an issue with calling a variable `name` in the welcome.js file; there is a function on the window global scope, which gets the name of the current window. To address this I changed it to `userName` and then it passed with no warnings.

### Chrome DevTools

I completed an audit on the web app.

Desktop
![contact-d](assets/readme/assets/test-results/Desktop.png)
Mobile
![contact-m](assest/../assets/readme/assets/test-results/Mobile.png)

- ### Performance = Ok

  - The comments from the program were due to having data in local storage which was affecting the loading time.

- ### Accessibility = Good

  - This test was 100 across all tests.

- ### Best Practices = Good

  - Marked down for having some images load in the wrong aspect ratio on some mobile screens.

- ### SEO = Good

  - No comments

## Manual testing

### Testing Environments

I used branches in Git to create a safer environment to develop different features and sections of the app. Once the initial section/feature had been finished and the initial test had been completed, the branch would merge with the master branch.

I used two sets of hardware to undergo building and completing the tests for the app; I was using a 2012 28 inc iMac and a 2020 13inch Mackbook air with the M1 processor. On both, I was primarily using the Google Chrome web browser.

### Desktop testing

Platforms :

- Mac book air 2020 M1 -OS Big Sur
- iMac - OS Catalina

Browsers:

- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari

Mobile testing:

- Pixel 3 (Android 11)
- iPhone 7 (IOS 14)

Browsers:

- Chrome
- Safari

## Testing - Design Responsiveness

### Simulated Testing

For each section on each page, I tested various screen sizes in the development environment. Using the Google Developer tools I tested the responsiveness throughout the development process. I updated the code as I tested, noting anything that appeared irregular or out of sync with the layout of the page.

Tested with Chrome DevTools using profiles for with screen sizes:

- Moto G4
- Galaxy S5
- Pixel 2
- Pixel 2 XL
- iPhone 5 SE
- iPhone 6/7/8
- iPhone 6/7/8 Plus
- iPhone X
- iPad
- iPad Pro

Also used the responsive profiles preset in the dev tools of:

- Mobile S (320px)
- Mobile M (375px)
- Mobile L (425px)
- Tablet (768px)
- Laptop (1024px)
- Laptop L (1440px)

## Major testing issues identified

- Smaller screens: The major problem I faced when testing on smaller screens was down to the pop up modal, I spent a long time trying to fix the formatting. As a result I changed the format of the app, choosing not to use any pop up modal's at all.

- Save buttons: I noticed when using the save button, the function would keep on printing the name to the screen repeatedly. To fix this, I made the page reload after saving.

## User testing

I had two users test my app remotely, although the reasons for them using the app does not align with the user story goals, having them use the app as a user and completing different tasks was beneficial.

### User Tests

Results from user 1 test:

- Spelling errors on metric and imperial drop down.
- Overall grammer check - some grammatical errors found (Example: no need to capitalize each letter in a heading/sentence I.e ‘Ok Chanel, Let’ Create A Meal Plan’ this can just be ‘Okay Chanel, let’s create a meal plan’.
- Button: change to 'create my plan'
- Clicked on a menu in my meal plan, then pressed back in the browser and the meal plan was gone. This should take the user back to the meal plan loading in the browser.
- Saved plan as ‘week 1’ went to saved plans, selected week 1 but unresponsive - app should have loaded the saved plan and rendered it the the HTML.
- Saved recipes: when there are no saved recipes, perhaps change the copy to ‘oh, looks like you don’t have any recipes saved. Click here to start building your meal plan’. Same for plans, when none are saved/made yet.

Results from user 2 test -

This user has a old HP laptop with a 700p screen and a wide aspect ratio, this user experienced multiple formatting issues, most have been fixed.

### User Goals

## Issues and challenges I encountered

### Modal - Redesign

The biggest issue I faced was having the app use modal’s to render certain types of information. The issue was occurring because I  was making the design responsive on smaller screens. Having a modal on smaller screens was a real issue and did not work. In trying to make it work the code started to feel quite fragile.

To fix this I decided to have a redesign of the app, and instead of rendering different HTML to the inside of a pop up modal, I chose to have it all on one web page. This gave me much more room to work with.

### Saved Recipe

When there was no saved recipes in storage no message was being rendered. The IF statement was checking for `array[0]`, which is true even IF the array is empty, I changed the IF statement to check IF the `array.length === 0`.

### Onclick function

The global onclick function that is set to prevent the page reloading on click, was showing an error in the console when the 'saved recipes' link was clicked. This was due to not having the correct parentNode. To fix this I placed the code inside an IF statement that will first check if the user is on the planner page.

### Edit recipe saved name

Editing the name of a saved recipe: the program would not check that the user input was a correct input so names could be saved as ``, which would be printed as `undifined`. To resolve this, I added a user input verification code.

### Weekly plan

This is a formatting bug, when shrinking the size of the viewing window in the browser, at a certain size the edge of the rendered weekly plan can be missed. I fixed this by adding `overflow: scroll` to the div element.

### Excessive white space

On some pages of the app there seems to be more white space than is needed for design purposes. I have a continued problem with the height of the main DIV. I could not get it to be flexible and change the position of the footer depending on the content.  I fixed this by adding `overflow: scroll` to the div element.

## Known bugs

### Low res screens

On low res screens that were outside the normal screen aspect ratio, the screens will experience strange formatting bugs, with there being overspill into the footer and into the nav bar sections on screens. This is due to the use of VH as a measurement to set the footer and the height of the main center section. With more time these formating issues can be addressed; my approach would be to alter the CSS so that each individual screen is catered for.

 </span>

## Deployment

I used multiple branches in this project; the master branch is the main deployment branch which will be the most up-to-date and deployable version of the code.

### API

The API uses a individual key to access the API, the key is already saved in the program so you will not have to generate one individually. You get 150 calls per day, there is more information in the documentation [here](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs/)

### How to deploy

To deploy this page to GitHub Pages from its GitHub repository, the following steps were taken:

- Select Settings from the top menu above the file window
- Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section
- Under Source click the drop-down menu and select Master Branch
- On selecting Master Branch the page will be automatically refreshed and the website is now deployed
- Scroll back down to the GitHub Pages section in Settings to retrieve the link to the deployed website.

## Future Features

### Shopping basket

- I would like to integrate a shopping basket where the app can format a shopping list from the meal plan.

### Rate the plan

- I would like to add a function where the user can rate the response (the meal plan created)from the API.
