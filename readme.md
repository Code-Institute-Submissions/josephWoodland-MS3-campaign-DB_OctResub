 ## The App Brief
 
This is a copy of the brief [here](assets/readme/assets/Brief%20-%20Cook%20It.pdf)
 
## Summary of the brief
 
The client requested a simple MVP to test the concept of the app. Something that they can put out into the marketplace to test the reaction. This meant that the app should have the core functionality of the business idea, giving the first test users the chance to create campaign's and then donate to other users campaigns.
 
The app will be accessible from marketing campaigns through social media, this means that the app must be functional from mobile, even if the design on mobile is limited, the basic functionality must be there.
 
The look of the app must be clean and more importantly functional, and clear to the user what is going on. They have expressed that the design of the app can be looked at further down the Road map and to make sure that the vast majority of the budget to be spent on the functionality.

 ## UX
 
### Target Audience
 
The target audience for this project can be split into two camps. Professional users with a decent disposable income have the ability to donate money to what they can determine as a good cause, and also users who are looking to achieve something and need the money for whatever their goal is. Both users are predicted to be millennials and gen Z so will be familiar with technology, so as long as the design follows what could be thought of as traditional placements of UI objects then =the users should be comfortable navigating to achieve the set goals.
 
## Website Goals
 
### Client
 
 To make a web application that:
 
- is easy to use and understand.
- will motivate/draw users back to the site each week.
- needs to feel responsive 
 
### Users
 
As a user I want:
 
- to be able to create my own profile
- to be able to donate to a good cause
- to be able to create a campaign for something that means a lot to me and have other people donate so I can achieve my goals
 
### Functions for the app
 
The app must:
 
- have the ability to have different user profiles.
- have the ability to add credits to the user profile
- when a user donates the amount donated is deducted from the user balance and added to the campaign balance
- when a campaign has hit its target there is some sort of user feedback to suggest this
- have a way to track the user transaction activity.
- have the ability to easily search through campaigns. 
 
## User Journey
 
This is an example of a successful user journey.
 
This is the journey of someone who wants to donate. 
 
I have been redirected to the app via a marketing campaign.
I have noticed a campaign that I would like to donate to.
I have been redirected to the signup page.
I have successfully created an account and given the ability to deposit some funds to my account.
I have managed to search or easily find the campaign I wanted to donate to.
I have usefully managed to donate to the campaign - noticing the change in the amount the campaign has been funded.
I can check my account to see that my credits have been reduced by the right amount
I can also verify this by looking at the transaction page to see a report of the transaction. 
 
 
This is the journey of someone who has a campaign that they are trying to raise money for. 
 
I am trying to raise money for my local school and came across this website.
I can see that you are able to raise money for a cause
I can see that some campaigns have already been successful in raising their targeted amount of money.
I have been directed to the user sign up page
I have managed to create a profile for myself.
I have managed to create engaging camping for the School
I have seen that money has come into the campaign. 
I can see which users have sent me the money via the transaction page. 
I can withdraw money from the camping pot and it will credit my account. 
 
## User Stories
 
For each of the interactions between user and software to complete a successful user journey, I will create a user story around essential actions. I will classify the users into either Donor or Campaigner 
 
As a Donor, I want to see more information about a live campaign so I can choose which campaign to donate to.
 
As a Doner, I want to add credits to my account so I can donate to a campaign.
 
As a Donor, I want to search for campaigns so I can see the progress of previous campaigns I have donated to.
 
As a Campaigner, I want to create a campaign so I can raise money for a cause I believe in.
 
As a Campaigner, I want to see how much money a campaign has made so I can see if I have support for my cause.
 
As a Campaigner, I want to withdraw money from the campaign account so I can fund the project.
 
As a Campaigner, I want to see who has donated to me so I can send them a thank you email, and keep them updated with the progress of the campaign.
 
## Sections of the Web App
 
### General Layout
 
Given the brief from the client, we are looking for a mobile responsive design where the basic features of the app can be achieved on mobile and also on the desktop. Not having the design process and layout to prefer one or the other 
 
### Navigation bar
 
The navigation bar should be simple and easy to understand and should be easily identifiable to the user whether they are logged in or not. 
 
Having a side navigation bar with all the different pages a user can navigate to, will breed familiarity with the site and reduce the risk of users getting lost in the app.
 
### Home page
 
The home page should have a list of some of the active campaigns, and also a section where users can see overfunded campaigns. Just to reassure some potential users that previous campaigns have reached their intended targets. 
 
### Profile page
 
The profile page must have all the basic user information in there, including the number of credits that the user has and the ability to add more if needed.
 
### Campaign View page
 
This should be a simple page with the campaign details on it and an easily identifiable way to donate.
 
### Campaign create
 
This should be a simple HTML form, easily identifiable tags for the user to fill out to create a campaign.
 
## Wireframes
 
Here is a sample of the original wireframes for the app approved by the client.

## Design
 
The design elements were influenced and informed by the client’s brief, that everything should be simple and not unique, but familiar.
 
### Font
 
### Copy
 
- Noto Sans JP and as a back up sans-serif
 
### Main colours
 
Brand colours are ![brand](assets/readme/xd/colourPalette.png)
 
## Features for the website
 
### Responsive design
 
- Websites must be functional on both large and small screens.
 
### Interactive page
 
- Page HTML must be interactive for the user and must feel fluid.
 
## Technologies Used
 
### Languages
 
HTML5 - I used HTML 5 for the layout and structure of the website.
 
CSS - CSS has been used to style some HTML elements.
 
Jquery - Jquery has been used to add to the front end interactivity of some HTML elements
 
Python - The Python language has been used the most in the making of this app. It has been used so the app can interact with the database.
 
MongoDb - I chose to use MongoDb as the database to store all of the necessary data that the app uses. 
 
Flask - I used the flask framework to build the app around. This framework has sped up the coding process and given a solid foundation to the app when years are navigating through the different functionalities.
 
Jinja - I used jinja HTML template language to make it easy for the HTML to be manipulated depending on what information is being sent to the app via the Python functions.
 
## Styling - Materialize
 
I have used Google materialize to standardize the styling of this app. Selecting the elements that I want and then copying and pasting the code into the HTML and also any Jquery code that is needed to make the element interactive.
 
## Coding Architecture 
 
I have used a simple architecture for this app with having all the code from each language in one file only. With all the Python code on an app.py file. I have separated the route functions from the other functions to help with the navigation, but have kept all the code in one place. 
 
## Database
 
I am using MongoDB to store the data for the app, trying to take advantage of the document style of saving data, meaning that instead of using look up tables to connect relevant data, all relevant data related to that particular document can be embedded into a single document. 
 
 
### Schema
 
Using a one-to-few approach to the relationship of my data, using referencing to connect given data together. I have decided to split the database up into three main collections, with the rationale of limiting the size of each document, each document having its own ‘_id’.
 
The reason behind this is there is a hard limit in the size of documents that can be saved to MongoDB of 16MB. As each user can have an unlimited number of transactions and an unlimited number of campaigns, saving each of these in a separate collection, with all the necessary tags to connect the user activity. 
 
User - This will keep all of the user data.
Campaigns - This will store all the data from each campaign.
Transactions - This will store data around each transaction that is completed through the app.
 
 
## VS Code
 
I used VS Code as my code editor. In the code editor, the extensions that I used were:
 
- Prettier: to automatically format my code for basic formatting mistakes and to have a consistent style throughout the code.
- Image preview: I used this extension that shows a preview of any linked images in my code to help me quickly identify if the URL path is correct and to identify the right image.
- Markdown all in one: I used this which enabled me to edit the readme file with live preview in VS Code.
 
## Python Libraries
 
I used modules to help me code the app faster using prewritten code to speed up the process.
 
- os - This module allows the app to have access to the operating system, giving the app the ability to access environment variables
- flask - This module is the framework for the app, allowing the app to have a user 
- flask_pymongo - This module allows the flask framework to connect with the MongoDB database.
- werkzeug.security - This module has been used to create user passwords and verification.
- datetime - This module has been used to record timestamps by the app.
 
## Outside libraries
 
- Google font: I used the Google font library for the font family on the website.
 
## Flask modules
 
- Flask - This is the main library of code for the framework
- flash - This allows the app to display flash messages on the screen when a specific action has been completed by the user.
- render_template - This directs the app to render a specific HTML template
- redirect - This directs the app to a HTML page inside the app on a user action
- request - This allows the app to interact with POST or GET requests from the HTML
- session - This allows the app to create users sessions allowing the ability to have the user logged in to the app. 
- url_for - This allows the HTML to have links that can interact with the flask code.
- g - I used this to set a global variable for users. 
 
 
## Software Used
 
- Git: This was used to manage the different versions of my project, using different branches to test and add new features/sections to the website. Once tested they were then merged into the master branch and then, using Git Desktop pushed to the GitHub repository.
 
- Git Desktop: I used this to manage commits and push them to the GitHub repository.
 
- Source tree: I used this to manage my git branches, and to edit commit messages.
 
- GitHub: I used GitHub to store the version of the project remotely.
 
- Adobe XD: I used XD to create and build the wireframes, to design some of the unique icons on the page and the unique colour patterns on the page.
 
## User input validation
 
I used different validation methods to make sure that the imputed data is valid. Using a mixture of HTML and Python data validation techniques. Using Python to check input against data in the database, i.e password check, and using the HTML to check the user input at the point of input. 
 
### HTML
 
Name validation - Using the ‘type=”text”’ attribute on the form with a ‘minlength=”3”’
Username validation - Using the ‘type=”email”’ attribute to make sure that the input follows the traditional email format.
Profile and campaign images - Using the ‘type=”file”’ attribute and specifying that it will only accept a ‘.jpg’ file. 
Password - Using the ‘type=”password”’ attribute on the form with a ‘minlength=”5”’
 
### Python
 
Username Validation - As we are using user emails as usernames, in the register function we check to see if the email is already in the database giving a different response on whether the user is registering or trying to login. 
Password - For registering we do basic checks to see if the two password inputs match for creating the user password.
Password - When the user is logging in, we grab the user data from the database and check the hashed password with the one that is stored for that user.
Images - I am using ‘app.config['MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH']’ to set the max size of the file, giving a flash message for the user.

### Testing Environments
 
I used branches in Git to create a safer environment to develop different features and sections of the app. Once the initial section/feature had been finished and the initial test had been completed, the branch would merge with the master branch.
 
I used two sets of hardware to undergo building and completing the tests for the app; I was using a 2012 28 inch iMac and a 2020 13inch Macbook air with the M1 processor. On both, I was primarily using the Google Chrome web browser.

## Testing - Design Responsiveness
 
### Simulated Testing
 
For each section on each page, I tested various screen sizes in the development environment. Using the Google Developer tools I tested the responsiveness throughout the development process. I updated the code as I tested, noting anything that appeared irregular or out of sync with the layout of the page.
 
Tested with Chrome DevTools using profiles for with screen sizes:
 
- Moto G4
- Galaxy S5
- Pixel 2
- Pixel 2 XL
- iPhone 5 SE
- iPhone 6/7/8
- iPhone 6/7/8 Plus
- iPhone X
- iPad
- iPad Pro
 
Also used the responsive profiles preset in the dev tools of:
 
- Mobile S (320px)
- Mobile M (375px)
- Mobile L (425px)
- Tablet (768px)
- Laptop (1024px)
- Laptop L (1440px)
